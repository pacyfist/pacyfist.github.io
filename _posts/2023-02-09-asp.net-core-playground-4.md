title:  "ASP.NET Core Playground - 4. Process data from SQL in batches"
---

So I had to make a background worker that was supposed to process a lot of data coming directly from the database and run all that data through a microservice via an API. Waiting to download everything needed from the database seemed slow and a bad API experience, but also I didn't want to flood the network by calling the API for every single data row.

So I came up with a nice and easy way of batching the data while streaming it.

We need two packages.

- First one is [`System.Linq.Async`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Linq.Async). Installing it allows us to use normal and clean LINQ syntax with `IAsyncEnumerables`.

- Second one is [`System.Reactive`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Reactive). This one allows us to use all the awesome features of reactive programming parading inside C#. If you know [`rxjs`](https://rxjs.dev/) you will understand `System.Reactive`.

Now to the point. This is an example how to process data coming from the database in batches.

```csharp
using System.Reactive.Linq;

return _dbContext.WeatherForecasts
    .AsAsyncEnumerable()
    .ToObservable()
    .Buffer(1000)
    .Select(d => d.Count)
    .ToAsyncEnumerable();
```

This we get an async enumerator that returns each iteration a list of 1000 rows. Best of both worlds!
