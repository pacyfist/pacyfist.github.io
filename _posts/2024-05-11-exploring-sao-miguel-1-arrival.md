Hello everyone! Usually, I share insights and tips about programming on this blog, but today I decided to do something a bit different. As some of you may know, my wife and I love to travel, and we always plan our trips by reading various travel blogs. So, I thought it would be a great idea to share our recent journey to São Miguel, one of the stunning islands in the Azores archipelago.

São Miguel captivated us with its breathtaking landscapes, volcanic lakes, and lush greenery. Although our trip was amazing, we encountered a few challenges that I'd like to highlight here so you can be better prepared for your own adventure on this magical island. In this post series, I'll walk you through our journey and show you how you can avoid some of the pitfalls we encountered.

## The Vehicle

After landing on São Miguel, our adventure began right away. We had arranged to rent a car from a local company. Upon exiting the airport, we called a special number provided by the rental agency. Shortly after, we were picked up at the designated meeting spot in parking lot P6. Finding the parking lot was a bit tricky as it wasn't immediately obvious; after exiting the airport, you need to turn right and walk for about 10 minutes.

## The Travel

As we navigated the winding roads, we couldn't resist pausing at several viewpoints along the way to soak in the island's natural beauty. However, with a rain ditch running alongside the road, each stop required extra caution when pulling off onto the shoulder. Despite the need for care, these stops provided us with unforgettable vistas, making the journey itself an integral part of our Azorean experience.

## The Destination

Our first destination was the enchanting town of Sete Cidades.

It's a quaint town nestled within the caldera of a massive, ancient volcano, the town boasts a unique and picturesque setting, with its tranquil atmosphere and charming, close-knit community of around 800 residents. Central to Sete Cidades is the Church of São Nicolau, a 19th-century structure that serves as an important landmark and gathering place for the locals. It also seemed like they were preparing to celebrate something, but more about that later.

## The Lakes

The town is renowned for its two stunning lakes, Lagoa Azul (Blue Lake) and Lagoa Verde (Green Lake), which are situated within the caldera. These lakes, separated by a narrow bridge, are famous for their striking colors, which result from differing depths and algae compositions. According to local legend, the lakes were formed from the tears of a shepherd and a princess who shared a forbidden love, with the blue and green hues reflecting their eyes.
