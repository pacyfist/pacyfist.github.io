title: "Reducing Boilerplate in Microservices with C# Code Generation"
---


## TL;DR

As microservices architectures grow, so does the challenge of managing repetitive code across multiple services. While traditional solutions like inheritance, generics, and reflection may help reduce boilerplate, they often add complexity and hinder readability. Code generation, however, offers a more effective and sustainable approach by automating the creation of clean, visible, and maintainable boilerplate code. With the continued advancements in tools like Roslyn and the C# language, developers can better address the challenges of microservices development, improving both performance and maintainability without sacrificing code clarity.

## Challenges of Boilerplate

In a microservices architecture, the system consists of multiple small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business function. This design often leads to significant boilerplate code, as essential functionalities—such as database connections, message consumers, background workers, and REST API configurations—must be implemented within each service separately. This repetitiveness results in numerous instances of nearly identical code scattered across the architecture, meaning that any updates or changes require maintenance in multiple locations. This increases the development and operational workload, as developers must ensure that that code remain consistent and up-to-date. Managing these duplicated components and keeping them synchronized becomes a substantial burden, reducing the efficiency and agility that microservices architecture aims to provide.

## Abstracting the Boilerplate

While concepts like inheritance, generics, and reflection can help reduce boilerplate code in a microservices architecture, they are not complete solutions to the problem. These techniques can minimize repetitive code by abstracting common functionality, but they often add layers of complexity that make the code harder to understand and slower to run. Inheritance and generics introduce tightly coupled hierarchies or generalized types that can obscure the purpose of specific code sections, complicating the logic for developers who need to trace behavior across multiple layers. Reflection, though powerful, introduces runtime processing that can slow down application performance and makes the code more opaque by hiding behavior behind dynamic constructs. Overall, these techniques decrease boilerplate only at the cost of increasing complexity and reducing code readability, which can lead to harder debugging and slower system performance.

## Generating the Boilerplate

To address these challenges, C# introduced code generator support into its compiler, Roslyn, allowing developers to automate the creation of repetitive code. Recently, many new C# language features have been designed specifically to simplify code generation. With code generators, developers can automate the creation of boilerplate code by using hints found in the project's code or metadata files. These generators programmatically produce necessary functionality—such as database connections or API endpoints—by writing clean, standardized code directly into the project. Unlike traditional techniques like inheritance or reflection, code generation keeps the boilerplate fully visible and straightforward, as the generated code is just another file within the solution, making it easy to review, maintain, and debug. For the compiler, these generated files are indistinguishable from hand-written code, making integration seamless and enhancing both the clarity and performance of the application.
