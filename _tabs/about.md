Hey there, I'm Filip Franik, a seasoned full-stack software developer ready to take on any coding challenge!

Being a senior full-stack developer requires a diverse set of skills. It's not just about coding the back-end and front-end; it's about mastering the art of user experience and interface design, delving into database administration, and even delving into the intricacies of development and operations. And let's not forget the essential soft skills needed to effectively communicate with clients.

In this rapidly evolving field, staying on top of all these areas is a constant learning process. As senior developers, we strive to absorb new knowledge every single day. That's why I created this websiteâ€”to consolidate my learnings and make them accessible to others. I believe that sharing my professional journey can help fellow coders dive deeper into the world of development and save precious time.

So, without further ado, let's dive in and get to work! Together, we'll conquer new horizons in the coding universe!
