Hi, my name is...

## Filip Franik

...and I'm a senior full-stack software developer.

It's hard to state how many skills are required to be an actual senior full-stack developer. You have to be productive in every aspect of creating a website. This includes not only knowing how to code back-end and front-end, but also designing parts of user experience and designing user interfaces, you also have to know a lot about database administration, and getting into development and operations. I'm not even mentioning the soft skills that are required while talking to customers.

All of those areas of expertise are improved daily by hundreds of professionals all over the world. This pretty much forces senior developers learn something new every day. What is more my learning has to be focused and on point. That's why I made this website. To keep everything I learned in one place and available to the public, because I think that story of my professional life can help others to get into coding a little deeper, and save someone else some time.

Let's get to work!
